## Ingredients

All you need, per person, is one large egg (free range) and 100 grams of plain flour.

## How

In a large bowl, combine the two and knead together until it forms a coarse doughy substance. Then, transfer it out of the bowl onto a smooth surface, slightly covered with flour and work the dough some more. Until it's elastic kinda...

Then cover it with cling film and leave it to rest in the fridge for about an hour.

Time to make the sauce, relax or something.

After an hour, take the dough out and roll flat with a rolling pin into sheets of 1 mm. Or you could invest in a pasta machine and feed it small amounts of dough.

When you have your sheets of pasta, cut them into ribbon aproximately 3/4 of a cm wide. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes and enjoy
