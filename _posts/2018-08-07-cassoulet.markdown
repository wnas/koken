- 2 onions
- 3 cloves of garlic
- a small pepper
( finely chopped )

- 50 ml of red wine
- a small tin of tomato puree

- courgette
- aubergine
- peppers
- tomatoes

first up, we make sure the courgette is cooked nice and brownish. For this we use a nice and big frying pan. When done, remove from the pan and into a bowl. Then, bake the aubergine and the peppers.

Meanwhile, in a big dutch oven, slowly fry the onions until soft. Then, add the garlic and the pepper. Fry for a little while, then add the rest of the vegetables and the wine. slowly simmer until about half of the wine is evaporated, then add the tomato puree and stir a bit.

After a few minutes, add the courgette, aubergine and peppers and leave to simmer for half an hour.
