  * 2 eggs
  * 100 grams of sugar
  * 200 grams of whipped cream
how_to: |-
    First you split the eggs. Whisk the egg yolk fluffy with 50 grams of sugar.

    The egg whites you beat untill you can lift the bowl upside down over your head without getting any of it on your head. Then whisk the remaining sugar through it.

    In a food processor beat the cream untill quite stiff.

    Fold the three parts together, slowly as not to lose the air in the cream and the eggs. Pour the mixture in a bowl and put in the freezer for about 4 hours, after that it is ready to serve... Enjoy.
